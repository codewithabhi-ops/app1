# app1

its a simple node app for testing!
so exactly i am doing is testing and docker container deployment practice! 
means i created this app and build and run a docker container 
then added new features in the application ------  then stopped the previous one and build and run the updated one! ------
hence the new changes would be reflected to the users!!!
